# project_capstone

project_capstone is a Aging, Dimentia and TBI study project done for the final cpastone project for Master of Applied Data Science program. With an aging population that continues to grow, we are seeing more and more people having neurodegenerative diseases, such as Dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. These diseases are caused by damage to nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. About 11% of the US population over the age of 65 are believed to be affected by dementia. The incidence of dementia onset is estimated to double every five years to about 40% to 60% after age 90. This significantly increases demands on the public health system and on medical and social services, causing large economic burden and healthcare challenges.
